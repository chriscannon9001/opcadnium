# opcadnium
OPto-CAD-nium - quick library and customizers for parametric 3d printable opto-mechanics.

(Formerly known as OptoSCAD.)

Plastic is always going to be second-rate for opto-mech, but it actually can do many jobs so long it's not expected to carry too heavy a load or meet interferometer precision.

This project is about opto-mech as fast and cheap as it can reasonably be.

## Installation

Install OpenSCAD, find your libraries folder.

Clone opcadnium from git into the libraries folder. Same goes for NopSCADlib (dependency) [https://github.com/nophead/NopSCADlib](https://github.com/nophead/NopSCADlib).

## Hardware Requirements

* 3d Printer
* stock of screws and nuts (e.g. M3, M4, M6)
* stock of springs (e.g. 6x20x.4 mm and 8x20x.8mm)
* (optional) chop saw
* (optional) metal stock, e.g. 6mm dia rod (for cages) and 12.7mm dia rod or tubes (for posts) 
* (optional) drill press and taps, i.e. for threading solid rod posts (not required)

## Getting started

The folder opcadnium/render has .stl files ready to open in a slicer or CAD, populated with some common variants.

See below under Project status to find links to Thingiverse, which offers 3d views of the same rendered .stl files.

Load a customizer from opcadnium/cust/*.scad in OpenSCAD to start customizing a design.

## Calibration

Many printers can probably start printing and the default margins will work.

But it's a good idea to print a copy of our calibration check and make sure the screws/nuts you intend to use fit properly in the pockets.

## Filaments

***Ranked by creep:***

* PLA (worst)
* PETG
* ASA, ABS
* PC (best)

Coincidentally or not, that's the same as sorting by increasing glass transition temperature Tg.

(Where does PA belong, perhaps between PETG and ASA?)

Some say composite filaments are more stable but my impression is the effect of filament filler is rather weak; PA-CF has higher creep and is also softer than PC, though it may be tougher in other ways.

## Project Status

Bringing every form of opto-mech into the project would be a little ambitious. The majority of the opto-mech that belongs is represented already.

I'm working on plans for test beds for benchmarks.

***Planned :***

* Lens Mount, XY
* Robotics

## Hardware Library

There are other hardware libraries out there already, but opcadnium includes its own hardware library. Why?

* [low level] Form negatives (pockets) for trapping nuts, counterboring screws, and allow quickly swapping metric and imperial types.
* [higher level] Form screw/spring adjuster sets, collar clamps, and more
* With 3d printing in mind.

Here is a brief demo snippet.

```
include <opcadnium/hw.scad>

$fa=2;
$fs=.2;

// SHC and hex nut with pockets
translate([0, -7, 0]) {
    %neg_hex("M3", 1.0, sink=5, capture=true, minor_access=5);
    vit_hex("M3", 1, TLshaft=8);
}
translate([0, -7, -6]) rotate([180, 0, 0]) {
    %neg_SHC("M3", 1.0, sink=3);
    vit_SHC("M3", 1);
}

// spring/screw adjuster with SHC and hex nut
// springspec - ["name", OD, wire, free-length, N-coils, isclosed, isflat, 2nd-OD, color]
spring = ["6x20", 6, .4, 20, 12, 1, 0, 0, "red"];
translate([0, 7, 0]) {
    %neg_adjuster_screwnutspring("M3", spring, l_compressed=6, washer=true, typehead=0, typenut=2, overhead=4);
    vit_adjuster_screwnutspring("M3", spring, l_compressed=6, washer=true, typehead=0, typenut=2);
}
```

### More hardware lib demo

Goto the folder opscadnium/demo and open of the demo files in OpenSCAD to see demonstrations in more detail. The files hw_pockets.scad and hw_features.scad and hwlookup.scad have additional usage documentation inline.
